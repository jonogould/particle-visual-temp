# VisualTemp

>A visual representation of the current temperature.

## Connections

1. Temperature is read via `A0`
2. RGB is connected to `D0`, `D1`, `D2` respectively
3. You can connect a laser to `D5` and it will turn on and off every 5 seconds

## Logic

```

 Purple (coldest)

 Blue

 Orange

 Red (hottest)

```
